- add user login
- track user's orders
- have user profile with order history


- add some reporting functionality to query orders by date
- API authentication for api keys
- make the api key auth not against a static api key, so multiple api keys can be used in different requests
- each api key should be authenticated against a user
- go ahead and write tests for everything up until now
- maybe refactor some stuff
- add repository tests? only really works with a local db so not that good  - see if we can implement
a smaller test db instead for tests to use
